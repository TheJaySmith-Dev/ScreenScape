# WatchNow

## Purpose
The primary purpose of WatchNow is to be a sophisticated and highly visual discovery platform for movies and TV shows. It's designed to go beyond a simple search engine, offering a curated, immersive experience that helps users explore the world of film and television and find exactly what they want to watch next, regardless of where it's available.

## Best Features
WatchNow is packed with features that create a premium and user-centric experience. Here are some of the standouts:

- **Curated Brand Hubs**: Organizes content into dedicated, beautifully designed hubs for major franchises like Marvel, Mission: Impossible, Ghostbusters, and Fast & Furious.
- **Deep Curation**: The Marvel hub features sub-collections for individual characters (like Iron Man and Captain America), each with a curated list of their essential MCU appearances.
- **Immersive Design**: Brand pages have unique landscape posters and custom "wallpaper" backdrops, creating a distinct and immersive feel for each franchise.
- **Personalized "For You" Recommendations**: The app learns your taste. By using the "Like" (üëç) and "Dislike" (üëé) buttons on any title, you train a recommendation engine that populates a dedicated "For You" page with suggestions tailored specifically to you.
- **Comprehensive "Where to Watch" Integration**: The detail page for any movie or show is a one-stop shop for viewing options. It intelligently uses your location to show:
  - Streaming & VOD: A clean list of services where you can stream, rent, or buy the title.
  - Cinema Showtimes: For new releases, it identifies that a movie is in theaters and provides links to find showtimes at major cinema chains in your country.
- **Advanced Content Discovery**: Browse the catalog in multiple intuitive ways beyond standard search:
  - By Streaming Service: See what's popular on Netflix, Disney+, Prime Video, etc.
  - By Production Studio: Explore studios like Pixar, A24, and Warner Bros., with interactive cards that play an animated GIF on hover.
  - By TV Network: Find shows from networks like HBO or AMC.
- **Rich, Cinematic Detail Pages**: Viewing a title's details is a rich experience, featuring:
  - Aggregated Ratings: Ratings from TMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic in one convenient view.
  - Custom Trailer Player: Trailers open in a sleek, custom-designed video player.
  - Actor Pages: Dedicated pages with biography and galleries for cast members.
- **"Coming Soon" with Countdown Timers**: A dedicated section builds anticipation for future releases, featuring posters with live countdown timers showing exactly when each will be available.
